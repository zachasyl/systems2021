# Lab 3 Process and Cache

Today is a two part lab!

1. Part 1 will provide some samples with using commands like [fork](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html) and [exec](https://linux.die.net/man/3/exec).
2. Part 2 will be a little [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)) simulator, where you can get some understanding of how our program structure affects how many cache hits we get.
